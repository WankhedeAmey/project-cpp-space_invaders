# project-cpp-space_invaders
A clone of space invaders game written in C++ using OpenGL library. 

A cpde woth 700 lines of clean and functional-components C++ code. I have attached a demo below. 
I have made use of OpenGL library for all the graphical implementations and power of C++ to gain fine control over each component of this game, including shooting mechanism, player and sprites movement. I have used all the advanced C++ techniques for the game including safe memory allocations.
